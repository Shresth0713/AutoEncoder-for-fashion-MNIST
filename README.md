# AutoEncoder-for-fashion-MNIST
This project implements an autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras to reconstruct images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. An autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, primarily for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and denoising.

The autoencoder learns to compress input images into a smaller latent space representation and then reconstruct them as accurately as possible. The reconstructed images are compared with the original images to evaluate the model's performance.

# ðŸ§  Autoencoder for Fashion MNIST Reconstruction

This project demonstrates the use of an **Autoencoder** to reconstruct images from the **Fashion MNIST dataset**. The model is trained to compress and reconstruct images, helping in tasks such as **denoising** and **anomaly detection**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses **Fashion MNIST dataset** for training and testing.
- Implements an **Autoencoder** using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Visualizes **original vs reconstructed images**.
- Saves and loads the trained model for reuse.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The **Fashion MNIST** dataset consists of **70,000 grayscale images** (28x28 pixels) in 10 clothing categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot
